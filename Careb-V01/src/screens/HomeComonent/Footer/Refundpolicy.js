                    Service fees at Caribbeaneaze are structured to align with the refund and cancellation policies set by our hosts. The basic fee for using Caribbeaneaze is 6% for guests of the total booking cost.
                  </Typography>
                  <Typography>
                    Hosts have the discretion to set up their cancellation policies, which directly impact the service fee structure. For example:
                  </Typography>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Canceling on the day of check-in: The applicable service fee depends on whether it's no refund, partial refund, or full refund.</li>
                    <li>Canceling 8 days before check-in: This could result in a full refund, with a service fee of 8%.</li>
                    <li>Canceling 3 days before check-in: The service fee might be 9% for a partial refund, depending on the host's policy.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <Typography>
                    These variations in service fees are designed to provide flexibility and choice for hosts while maintaining transparency for guests regarding potential charges when booking.
