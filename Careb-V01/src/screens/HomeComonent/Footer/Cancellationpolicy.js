      <h2>Cancellation by Customer</h2>
      <p>
        If you need to cancel your booking, please contact us as soon as
        possible. Cancellations made within 24 hours of booking will receive a
        full refund. Cancellations made after 24 hours may be subject to
        cancellation fees.

      <h2>Cancellation Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Cancellations made after 24 hours from the time of booking may incur a
        cancellation fee of up to 50% of the total booking amount. The exact fee
        will depend on the terms and conditions of the service provider.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Refundable Services</h2>
      <p>
        Certain services are non-refundable and cannot be canceled once booked.

      </ul>

      <h2>Refund Process</h2>
      <p>
        If eligible, refunds will be processed within 7-10 business days to the
        original method of payment. We will notify you once your refund has been
